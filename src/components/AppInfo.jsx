    <div>This is a web application that allows users to generate and manage a collection of unique cards, each with a random number and ID between 1 and 1000. The user can add new cards to the collection, with a maximum limit of 1000 cards. The user can also delete cards and sort the collection by card number. The collection is saved locally, so the user's progress is preserved even if the page is refreshed.</div>
